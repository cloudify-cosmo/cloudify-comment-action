## Notes

* to activate the comment part correctly , the workflow should be defined on your default branch -bellow an example how to use it-
* this action can trigger any command that you can execute using cloudify-cosmo/cli-action which interface with `cfy` cli command
* this action handles terraform comments [`cfy terraform plan`, `cfy terraform apply`, `cfy terraform destroy`] which triggers the following actions respectively [cloudify-cosmo/terraform-plan-action, cloudify-cosmo/terraform-apply-action, cloudify-cosmo/terraform-destroy-action] , it will checkout the head branch that you opened a Poll Request from if you don't pass `module-file` value
